This is a collaboration between four artists:

    Clint Bellanger created the original models and raw renders for the others to paint over
    Blarumyrran created the Leather Chest and Plate Chest
    crowline (CrowLineStudio) created the Cloth set
    Justin Nichol created the rest of the Robes, Leather, Chain, Plate sets

All have agreed to release these CC0 (Public Domain) to match the license originally chosen by Blarumyrran for the previous icons.
