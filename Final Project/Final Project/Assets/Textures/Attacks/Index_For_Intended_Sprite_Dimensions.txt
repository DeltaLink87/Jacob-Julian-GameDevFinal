/*
followed a basic formula for converting
the attack images into width/height ratios and
multiplying by 2.
For example:
DaggerAttackIcon is 295x136
295 / 136 = 2.16911
which is close (enough) to 2.1666667
which gives a basic converted ratio of 13/6 -> 26/12
it's basic, it doesn't make much sense, but it's
good for maintaining the sprite's image integrity.
had to do some specific scaling operations on the
small icon sprites to get decent attack images.
